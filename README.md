# 🧠 Testing AI Browsers: ChatGPT Atlas vs Perplexity Comet

This repo documents an experiment by **Mo Awad** comparing how next-gen AI browsers answer marketing-related queries — specifically:

> “What’s the fastest way for a brand to dominate organic visibility in AI answers?”

## 🎯 Purpose
I ran this test to understand how AI browsers are reshaping **brand visibility, discovery, and authority** in the age of **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)**.

- **Shift in Search Behavior:** From query → conversation  
- **Impact on Organic Reach:** New signals determine brand ranking  
- **Strategic Advantage:** Early insight into AI-driven visibility dynamics

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Comet delivers strategy; Google lists tactics.**  
- **AI answers explain *why* content ranks, not just *how* to optimize it.**  
- **Perplexity Comet outperformed Google** in depth, reasoning, and actionable insights for marketers.

> 🏆 *In short: Google told us what to do. Comet told us why it works.*
